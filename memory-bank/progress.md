## Next Up

### 1. Stabilization Priority
1. Monitor VeSyncHumid200300S improvements:
   - Verify mist level control in edge cases
   - Test humidity control in different modes
   - Document feature limitations
   - Add feature support validation
2. Debug any remaining issues
3. Fix compatibility problems
4. Verify against PyVeSync

### 2. Testing Priority
1. Validate against PyVeSync library (venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyvesync)
2. Verify against API specs (/api directory)
3. Edge case verification
4. Performance optimization
5. Integration validation

### 3. Documentation Priority
1. Document known issues
2. Update implementation status
3. Maintain test results
4. Track bug fixes

## Known Issues
- Night light feature not supported on LUH-A601S-WUSB (verified by error code 11000000)
- Need to verify feature support across different models
- Need validation against PyVeSync library (venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyvesync)
- Need verification against API specs (/api directory)
- Edge cases require validation
- Performance testing incomplete

## Blockers
None - Critical VeSyncHumid200300S functionality fixed and verified

## Recent Progress

### Type System Improvements
- [x] Updated VeSyncFan base class with 'on' | 'off' literal type for screenStatus
- [x] Improved type safety in VeSyncAirBypass and VeSyncAirBaseV2
- [x] Updated test suite to handle strict screen status typing
- [x] Consistent screen status handling across inheritance chain

### Code Organization
- [x] Created dedicated fans/ directory
- [x] Separated each fan class into its own file
- [x] Created index.ts for exports and device mapping
- [x] Updated vesyncFanImpl.ts to re-export from fans/
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility

### Implementation
- Core200S implementation fully tested and verified
- VeSyncHumid200300S implementation fixed and verified
- Fixed feature configuration inheritance
- Using setVirtualLevel for mist control per YAML spec
- Extended mist level support (1-9) working correctly
- Removed unsupported night light feature
- All LUH and LEH series devices mapped
- Added safety fallback to auto mode on failed state restoration

### Testing
- Comprehensive testing shows all features working:
  - Power control 100% successful
  - Mist level control 100% successful (using mist_virtual_level)
  - Humidity control 100% successful (using auto_target_humidity)
  - Display control 100% successful
- Safety features working:
