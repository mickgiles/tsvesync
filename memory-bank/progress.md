## In Progress

### 1. Testing and Validation
- [ ] Validate against PyVeSync library (venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyvesync)
- [ ] Verify against API specs (/api directory)
- [ ] Edge case validation
- [ ] Performance testing
- [ ] Error handling verification

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- [ ] Validation test suite
- [ ] Type testing
- [ ] Integration testing
- [ ] Coverage reporting

## Next Up

### 1. Stabilization Priority
1. Identify problematic devices
2. Debug implementation issues
3. Fix compatibility problems
4. Verify against PyVeSync

### 2. Testing Priority
1. Validate against PyVeSync library (venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyvesync)
2. Verify against API specs (/api directory)
3. Edge case verification
4. Performance optimization
5. Integration validation

### 3. Documentation Priority
1. Document known issues
2. Update implementation status
3. Maintain test results
4. Track bug fixes

## Known Issues
- Some devices may have implementation issues
- Need validation against PyVeSync library (venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyvesync)
- Need verification against API specs (/api directory)
- Edge cases require validation
- Performance testing incomplete

## Blockers
None currently - focus is on stabilization
