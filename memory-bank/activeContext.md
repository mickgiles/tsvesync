# Active Context

## Current Focus
Fixing and validating the LUH-A601S-WUSB humidifier implementation. While most devices are working correctly, this specific model needs attention.

## Recent Changes
1. **Implementation Status Update**
   - Identified issues with LUH-A601S-WUSB humidifier
   - Most other devices working correctly
   - Need to validate against PyVeSync and API specs
   - Focusing on humidifier test script

## Active Decisions

### 1. Documentation Structure
- Using Memory Bank pattern for comprehensive documentation
- Mermaid diagrams for visual documentation
- Strict separation of concerns in documentation files

### 2. Implementation Approach
- Following YAML-first development
- Strict type safety requirements
- PyVeSync compatibility as primary constraint
- Validation against two sources of truth:
  1. PyVeSync Library (venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyvesync)
  2. API Specifications (/api directory)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Testing and Validation**
   - Comprehensive testing of all devices
   - Validation of edge cases
   - Performance testing
   - Error handling verification

2. **Issue Resolution**
   - Compare against PyVeSync library (venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyvesync)
   - Verify against API specs (/api directory)
   - Debug implementation discrepancies
   - Fix compatibility issues
   - Validate fixes against both sources

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Document known issues
   - Update implementation status
   - Maintain test results
   - Track bug fixes

### Upcoming Work
1. **Stabilization**
   - Fix identified issues
   - Improve error handling
   - Enhance test coverage
   - Performance optimization

2. **Validation**
   - Complete device testing
   - Edge case verification
   - PyVeSync compatibility checks
   - Integration testing

3. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation
   - Document known limitations
   - Maintain implementation notes
   - Track resolved issues

## Current Challenges

### 1. Technical Challenges
- Ensuring exact PyVeSync compatibility (venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyvesync)
- Maintaining strict type safety
- Managing device-specific implementations
- Matching API specifications (/api directory)

### 2. Documentation Challenges
- Keeping documentation synchronized
- Tracking implementation progress
- Maintaining clear development context

## Active Considerations

### 1. Type System
- Interface design decisions
- Generic type constraints
- Null safety approach

### 2. Testing Strategy
- Validation server integration
- Test coverage requirements
- Error scenario testing

### 3. Documentation Updates
- When to update Memory Bank
- Progress tracking method
- Change documentation process

## Implementation Notes

### Current Status
- All device types implemented
- Core functionality working
- Testing and validation ongoing
- Some devices may need fixes

### Known Issues
- Some devices may have implementation issues
- Need comprehensive testing for all devices
- Validation needed for edge cases

### Questions to Resolve
1. Test coverage requirements
2. Version numbering strategy
3. Release process definition

## Recent Decisions
1. Memory Bank structure established
2. Documentation patterns defined
3. Implementation approach determined
