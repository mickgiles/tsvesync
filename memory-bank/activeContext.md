# Active Context

## Current Focus
Code reorganization and VeSyncHumid200300S implementation improvements.

## Recent Changes

1. **Core200S Improvements**
   - Added fan_speed and auto_mode features to configuration
   - Fixed config overwriting issue in VeSyncAirBypass
   - All tests passing (13/13 - 100% success rate):
     * Power control (on/off)
     * Mode control (auto, manual, sleep)
     * Fan speed control (levels 1-3)
     * Display control (on/off)
     * State restoration
   - Verified proper feature detection and operation
   - Confirmed state restoration functionality

2. **Screen Status Type Improvements**
   - Updated VeSyncFan base class to use 'on' | 'off' literal type for screenStatus
   - Improved type safety in VeSyncAirBypass and VeSyncAirBaseV2
   - Updated test suite to handle strict screen status typing
   - Consistent screen status handling across inheritance chain

2. **Code Reorganization**
   - Created dedicated fans/ directory for fan implementations
   - Separated each fan class into its own file:
     - airBypass.ts: VeSyncAirBypass class
     - airBaseV2.ts: VeSyncAirBaseV2 class
     - towerFan.ts: VeSyncTowerFan class
     - humidifier.ts: VeSyncHumidifier class
     - warmHumidifier.ts: VeSyncWarmHumidifier class
     - humid200300S.ts: VeSyncHumid200300S class
   - Created fans/index.ts for exports and device mapping
   - Updated vesyncFanImpl.ts to re-export from fans/

3. **Implementation Status**
   - VeSyncHumid200300S implementation fixed and verified
   - Mist level control using setVirtualLevel per YAML spec
   - Extended mist level support (1-9) working correctly
   - Added warm mist status tracking
   - Night light feature removed (not supported by device)

4. **Testing Results**
   - All tests passing (22/22 - 100% success rate)
   - Power control working correctly
   - Mist level control fixed (using mist_virtual_level)
   - Humidity control fixed (using auto_target_humidity)
   - Display control working properly
   - State restoration working correctly
   - Safety fallback to auto mode when needed

5. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Created comprehensive VeSyncHumid200300S API documentation
   - Added installation and setup instructions
   - Documented all available methods and features
   - Included TypeScript examples for all operations
   - Added best practices and type safety guidelines

## Active Decisions

### 1. Type System Improvements
- Strict literal types for status values
- Consistent type handling across inheritance
- Type-safe state management
- Improved test type coverage

### 2. Code Organization
- One class per file for better maintainability
- Clear file naming convention
- Logical directory structure
- Separation of concerns
- Backward compatibility through re-exports

### 3. Implementation Approach
- Following YAML-first development
- Strict type safety requirements
- PyVeSync compatibility as primary constraint
- Validation against two sources of truth:
  1. PyVeSync Library (venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pyvesync)
  2. API Specifications (/api directory)

### 4. Documentation Structure
- Using Memory Bank pattern for comprehensive documentation
- Mermaid diagrams for visual documentation
- Strict separation of concerns in documentation files
- Detailed API documentation in docs/ directory
- TypeScript examples for all features

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. **Implementation Improvements**
   - Monitor for any edge cases in mist level control
   - Verify humidity control in different modes
   - Document device-specific feature limitations
   - Consider adding validation for supported features

2. **Implementation Verification**
   - Compare against PyVeSync library
   - Verify API endpoints match YAML specs
   - Test payload structures
   - Validate response handling
   - Fix any compatibility issues

3. **Documentation Updates**
   - Document known issues
   - Update implementation status
   - Maintain test results
   - Track bug fixes
   - Consider documenting other device types

### Upcoming Work
1. **Stabilization**
   - Fix identified issues
   - Improve error handling
   - Enhance test coverage
   - Performance optimization

2. **Validation**
   - Complete device testing
   - Edge case verification
   - PyVeSync compatibility checks
   - Integration testing

3. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation
   - Document known limitations
   - Maintain implementation notes
   - Track resolved issues

## Current Challenges

### 1. Technical Challenges
- Ensuring exact PyVeSync compatibility
- Maintaining strict type safety
- Managing device-specific implementations
- Matching API specifications

### 2. Documentation Challenges
- Keeping documentation synchronized
- Tracking implementation progress
- Maintaining clear development context
- Ensuring documentation completeness

## Active Considerations

### 1. Type System
- Interface design decisions
- Generic type constraints
- Null safety approach

### 2. Testing Strategy
- Validation server integration
- Test coverage requirements
- Error scenario testing

### 3. Documentation Updates
- When to update Memory Bank
- Progress tracking method
- Change documentation process
- API documentation standards

## Implementation Notes

### Current Status
- All device types implemented
- Core functionality working
- Testing and validation ongoing
- Core200S fully tested and verified
- Code organization improved
- API documentation complete for VeSyncHumid200300S
- Feature detection working correctly

### Known Issues
- Night light feature not supported on LUH-A601S-WUSB
- Need to verify feature support across different models
- Need comprehensive testing for all devices
- Validation needed for edge cases

### Questions to Resolve
1. How to handle unsupported features across different models
