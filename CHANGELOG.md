## [1.0.103] - 2025-08-25

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: EU Authentication Finally Working**: EU accounts that start with US region (default in Homebridge) now correctly authenticate by automatically switching to EU region when a cross-region error is detected
  - Simplified cross-region error handling in Step 2 authentication to immediately return 'cross_region_retry'
  - When error -11261022 is received, immediately retry entire auth flow with alternate region instead of attempting token-based retry
  - Removed complex token retry logic that was preventing proper region switching
  - EU accounts now authenticate in approximately 2.5 seconds with automatic region detection
  - Resolves critical issue where EU accounts were failing with "access region conflict error" even after previous fix attempts
- **Improved Bad Credential Handling**: Enhanced authentication error detection for faster failure response
  - Invalid credentials now fail fast in 0.1-1.3 seconds (previously took up to 7.5 seconds)
  - System detects credential error codes and stops retrying immediately:
    - -11201129: "account or password incorrect"
    - -11202129: "the account does not exist"  
    - -11000129: "illegal argument" (empty credentials)
  - Clear error messages for authentication failures with specific error code recognition
  - Eliminates unnecessary retry loops for obviously bad credentials, improving user experience

### Changed
- **Enhanced Cross-Region Error Handling**: Streamlined authentication flow for EU users
  - Step 2 authentication now immediately detects cross-region errors and triggers region switching
