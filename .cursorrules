</checklist>

<failure_conditions>
STOP and DO NOT proceed if:
- Any documentation file is unread or unsummarized
- Source code structure is not reviewed
- Verification is incomplete
- Understanding is not demonstrated

You MUST NOT:
- Make code changes before completing verification
- Skip any documentation files

<first_response_format>
When first initialized or receiving any message in a new conversation, MUST respond in this order:
1. "Initializing - completing mandatory pre-task requirements..."
2. [Show progress through requirements]
3. [Provide verification summaries]
4. "Pre-task requirements complete. Now I can assist you."
5. Only then acknowledge user's message

# TypeScript and NestJS Development Guidelines

## General TypeScript Guidelines

### Core Principles

- All code and documentation must be written in English
- Types must be explicitly declared for all variables and functions (parameters and return values)
- Avoid using the `any` type - create specific types when needed
- Document all public classes and methods using JSDoc
- Maintain clean code structure without blank lines within functions
- Follow the single export per file principle

### Naming Conventions

#### Case Styles
- Use **PascalCase** for classes
- Use **camelCase** for variables, functions, and methods
- Use **kebab-case** for files and directories
- Use **UPPERCASE** for environment variables

#### Naming Rules
- Replace magic numbers with named constants
- Begin all functions with a verb
- Use verb prefixes for boolean variables:
  - `isLoading`, `hasError`, `canDelete`, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations, except for:
  - Standard terms: API, URL, etc.
  - Common programming abbreviations:
    - `i`, `j` for loop iterators
    - `err` for errors
    - `ctx` for contexts
    - `req`, `res`, `next` for middleware parameters

### Function Guidelines

#### General Rules
- Keep functions concise and focused (under 20 instructions)
- Name functions using verb-noun combinations
- Use prefix conventions for specific return types:
  - Boolean returns: `isX`, `hasX`, `canX`
  - Void returns: `executeX`, `saveX`

#### Best Practices
- Minimize nesting through:
  - Early returns and validation checks
  - Utility function extraction
- Utilize higher-order functions (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Implement arrow functions for simple operations (< 3 instructions)
- Use named functions for complex operations
- Set default parameter values instead of null checks
- Follow RO-RO (Receive Object-Return Object) principle:
  - Accept objects for multiple parameters
  - Return objects for multiple values
- Maintain single level of abstraction

### Data Management

- Encapsulate data in composite types rather than primitive types
- Use classes with internal validation instead of standalone validation functions
- Enforce immutability:
  - Use `readonly` for static properties
  - Use `as const` for immutable literals

### Class Design

#### SOLID Guidelines
- Follow SOLID principles
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Define contracts through interfaces

#### Size Constraints
- Keep classes focused and manageable:
  - Maximum 200 instructions
  - Maximum 10 public methods
  - Maximum 10 properties

### Error Handling

- Use exceptions for unexpected error scenarios
- Exception handling should:
  - Address anticipated issues
  - Provide additional context
  - Defer to global handler when appropriate

### Testing Practices

#### General Testing
- Structure tests using Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Use clear variable naming conventions:
  - `inputX`, `mockX`, `actualX`, `expectedX`
- Write unit tests for all public functions
- Implement test doubles for dependencies
  - Exception: lightweight third-party dependencies
- Create acceptance tests per module using Given-When-Then

## NestJS Specific Guidelines

### Architectural Structure

#### Module Organization
- Implement modular architecture
- Create one module per main domain/route
- Structure modules with:
  - Primary controller for main route
  - Secondary controllers as needed
  - Models directory containing:
    - DTOs with class-validator
    - Output type definitions
  - Services module for:
    - Business logic
    - MikroORM entities
    - Entity-specific services

#### Core Components
- Core module containing:
  - Global exception filters
  - Request management middleware
  - Permission guards
  - Request interceptors

#### Shared Resources
- Shared module containing:
  - Utility functions
  - Common business logic

### Best Practices

- Keep modules focused and domain-specific
- Implement proper validation at DTO level
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Follow NestJS dependency injection patterns
- Use appropriate decorators for route handling
